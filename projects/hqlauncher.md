# HQLauncher

HQLauncher started as my first ever concept. And now I'm making it real.

The goal of HQL is to make a functional Minecraft launcher, one that has way more useful tools to handle multiple instances, mods, packs, skins, and accounts.

We already have this, with other 3rd party launchers, so I wanted to make something like that, but with better UI, and with even more features.

### HQLauncher is now in development.
