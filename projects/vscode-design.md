# Visual Studio Code Redesign
### Concept

[Click me](https://youtu.be/HrlNTIbo9o4)

I gave Visual Studio Code a redesign, using Windows 11 design language.

Not much of the layout changed, mainly the cards, look, and feel of the app. I wanted it to feel more tied in with Windows 11. And I know VS Code is multi platform, and I don't know what the app would look like on other platforms. This is just a concept.

Copilot is now in VS Code, for free. Right click on an error to find out what it means, with whatever AI engine you want. Bing AI, Phind (GPT-4), GitHub Copilot, or Google Bard.

The project I featured in the code editor is [HQLauncher (click)](/work/hqlauncher)

This is just a concept, NOT a real product.
